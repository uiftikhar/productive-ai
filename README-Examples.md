# User Context Integration Examples and Fixes

## Code Fixes Implemented

### Type Fixes
1. **getCurrentSegmentId Method**: Fixed to ensure it always returns a string type.
   - Location: `src/shared/services/user-context/conversation-context.service.ts`
   - Issue: Method was returning undefined in some cases
   - Solution: Added fallback to ensure string return

2. **Type Compatibility Issues**: Resolved incompatibility with the `retentionPolicy` property.
   - Location: `src/shared/services/user-context/user-context.facade.ts`
   - Issue: Type mismatch between `additionalMetadata` and expected types
   - Solution: Properly typed `additionalMetadata` to match expected structure

3. **Logger Format Corrections**: Fixed logger calls to conform to proper formats.
   - Location: `src/agents/examples/enhanced-conversation-mock-example.ts`
   - Issue: `logger.error` calls were passing strings instead of objects
   - Solution: Modified error logging to pass properly formatted objects

### Mock Implementations

Due to integration issues with existing services, mock implementations were created:

1. **Mock UserContextFacade**: Created a simplified version for testing.
   - Location: `src/langgraph/examples/supervisor-mock-context-example.ts`
   - Features: Basic conversation tracking, simple segment management, and minimal search capability
   - Purpose: Enable testing without external dependencies

2. **MockContextStorage**: Implemented in-memory storage for conversation turns.
   - Location: `src/agents/examples/enhanced-conversation-mock-example.ts`
   - Features: Maps for storing conversations and segments, methods for managing conversation data
   - Purpose: Demonstrate conversation management features without database dependencies

## Example Implementations

### 1. Supervisor Workflow with Context Integration

An example demonstrating how the `SupervisorWorkflow` integrates with `UserContextFacade`:

- Location: `src/langgraph/examples/supervisor-mock-context-example.ts`
- Features:
  - Creates a workflow with mock context integration
  - Shows how context is retrieved during task planning
  - Demonstrates recording of task assignments and results
  - Verifies context storage and retrieval

### 2. Enhanced Conversation Management

An example showcasing advanced conversation management features:

- Location: `src/agents/examples/enhanced-conversation-mock-example.ts`
- Features:
  - Agent-specific segmentation
  - Retention policy management
  - Enhanced metadata support for conversation turns
  - Advanced search capabilities with filters

### 3. History-Aware Supervisor Workflow

A comprehensive example demonstrating a history-aware supervisor implementation:

- Location: `src/examples/history-aware-workflow.ts`
- Features:
  - Context-aware workflow execution
  - Conversation history integration
  - Analytics-driven decision making
  - Agent selection based on historical performance
  - Relevance-ranked historical context
  - Multi-turn conversation continuity

## Running the Examples

### Supervisor with Context Example
```bash
npx ts-node src/langgraph/examples/supervisor-mock-context-example.ts
```

This example demonstrates:
- Initialization of MockUserContextFacade
- Creation of test user and conversation
- Registration of test agents
- Execution of supervisor workflow with context integration
- Verification of context retrieval during task planning

### Enhanced Conversation Example
```bash
npx ts-node src/agents/examples/enhanced-conversation-mock-example.ts
```

This example demonstrates:
- Modular context storage implementation
- Enhanced metadata tracking for conversation turns
- Conversation segmentation support
- Agent-specific filtering of conversation history
- Retention policy management
- Advanced search capabilities

### History-Aware Workflow Example
```bash
npx ts-node src/examples/history-aware-workflow.ts
```

This example demonstrates:
- Integration of conversation history into workflow execution
- Context-aware task assignment to specialized agents
- Follow-up question handling with continuity
- History summarization for token efficiency
- Analytics-enhanced decision making
- Progressive conversation across multiple turns

## Key Takeaways

1. **Modular Context Storage**: The system supports different storage implementations through a common interface.
2. **Enhanced Metadata Tracking**: Conversation turns can include rich metadata for better context.
3. **Segmentation Support**: Conversations can be segmented by topic or agent capability.
4. **Context-Aware Workflows**: SupervisorWorkflow can access and utilize historical context.
5. **Retention Management**: Conversations can have configurable retention policies.
6. **History-Awareness**: Workflows can maintain continuity across conversation turns.
7. **Analytics Integration**: Decision making can be enhanced with conversation analytics.

These examples and fixes demonstrate how the User Context integration enhances the LangGraph workflow system with improved context awareness and conversation management capabilities.
