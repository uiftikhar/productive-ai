# Transcript Analysis Interface: Frontend Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for building a modern transcript analysis interface using Next.js 14 with App Router. The application will enable users to upload meeting transcripts, analyze them individually using the MeetingAnalysisAgent, automatically classify themes, and compare transcripts with similar themes using the KnowledgeGapAgent to identify divergences and knowledge gaps.

## Implementation Approach

### User Experience Flow

1. **User logs in** through NextAuth.js authentication
2. **User uploads transcripts** individually or in batches
3. **System automatically analyzes** each transcript using MeetingAnalysisAgent
4. **Theme classification** is performed to categorize each transcript
5. **System identifies similar transcripts** based on theme classification
6. **Knowledge gap analysis runs in background** for transcripts with same theme
7. **User receives notification** when analysis is complete
8. **User explores visualizations** of knowledge gaps and themes
9. **User can interact with** recommendations and insights
10. **User can export or share** the analysis results

### State Management Strategy

- **React Context**: For global application state (user preferences, current view)
- **React Query**: For server state management (transcripts, analysis results)
- **Local Component State**: For UI-specific state (form inputs, modals)
- **URL State**: For shareable state (current transcript, filters)

### API Communication Pattern

- **Server Actions**: For data mutations (upload, save, delete)
- **API Routes**: For complex operations requiring agent integration
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement with React Query for optimal performance
- **Optimistic Updates**: For responsive user experience

### Background Processing

- **Webhook System**: For long-running agent processes
- **Notification Center**: To alert users of completed analyses
- **Progress Tracking**: For visibility into processing status
- **Retry Mechanism**: For handling failed analysis attempts

## Considerations

### Scalability
- Design for handling large numbers of transcripts
- Implement pagination and virtualization for performance
- Create efficient data structures for quick filtering and searching

### Accessibility
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Ensure screen reader compatibility
- Maintain sufficient color contrast

### Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Protect API routes with appropriate middleware
- Implement rate limiting for API calls

### Privacy
- Store only necessary transcript data
- Implement data retention policies
- Provide options for transcript deletion
- Add consent management for analysis

## Next Steps

### Current Focus: Completing Phase 1
- Configure React Query for server state management
- Develop user profile and settings pages
- Set up API route structure and error handling
- Create component library documentation

### Upcoming: Phase 2
- Begin implementation of transcript management
- Develop upload interface for transcripts
- Create transcript viewing experience

After approval of this development plan:

1. Create detailed component specifications
2. Develop initial wireframes and design mockups
3. Set up development environment and CI/CD pipeline
4. Begin implementation with Phase 1
