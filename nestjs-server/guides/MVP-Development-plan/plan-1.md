# Analysis of Current System & Development Plan for MVP Features

## Current System Analysis

The NestJS server implements a sophisticated meeting analysis system using LangGraph with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities. Here's what's currently built:

### Core Architecture
- **LangGraph Framework**: Implements stateful, multi-agent workflows
- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Specialized agents for different analysis tasks
- **RAG Enhancement**: Contextual retrieval from previous meetings
- **Web API & WebSockets**: REST endpoints and real-time updates

### Existing Capabilities
1. **Meeting Analysis Pipeline**  
   - Topic extraction (identifies main discussion points)  
   - Action item extraction (tasks, assignees, deadlines)  
   - Sentiment analysis (emotional tone of discussions)  
   - Participant dynamics analysis  
   - Meeting summarization  

2. **RAG-Enhanced Contextual Understanding**  
   - Links current discussions with historical context  
   - Retrieves relevant information from previous meetings  
   - Enhances the quality of extracted information  

3. **Basic External Integration Framework**  
   - Placeholder implementations for Jira, Asana, and Slack  
   - Currently in "test mode" only (no actual API calls)

## Alignment with PRD Market Analysis

This development plan addresses the key hypotheses in the lean startup analysis:

1. **Meeting Overload & Follow-up Pain**: Automated meeting analysis and action item tracking.  
2. **AI Time Savings**: Automating routine tasks across meetings, tasks, and email.  
3. **Progressive Trust**: Approval workflows with gradual autonomy increase.  
4. **Integration-First**: Deep integration with existing tools reduces friction.  
5. **UK/EU Market Focus**: Designed with GDPR compliance in mind.

The plan also supports the core Jobs-to-be-Done from the PRD:
- “Help me turn meeting talk into action” (Phase 1)  
- “Keep track of everything I need to do across all my apps” (Phase 2)  
- “Optimize my schedule and communications” (Phase 3)
