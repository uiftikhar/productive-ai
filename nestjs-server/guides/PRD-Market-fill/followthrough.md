# FollowThrough AI: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Vision

Imagine ending a meeting and finding that next steps are already in motion—follow-up emails drafted, calendar invites sent, documents created—all by an AI that understood the context and took initiative. FollowThrough AI transforms AI from a passive note-taker into an autonomous executive assistant delivering tangible outcomes.

## Problem & Opportunity

Modern knowledge workers face:

* **Follow-Through Gap**: Difficulty ensuring action items are completed post-meeting.
* **Administrative Overload**: Time lost scheduling meetings, drafting emails, and task management.
* **Information Silos**: Scattered critical context across platforms leading to inefficiencies.
* **Lack of Support**: Most professionals lack a dedicated executive assistant.

## Solution Overview

FollowThrough AI is an AI Chief of Staff that:

* Provides real-time meeting intelligence (summaries, tasks).
* Executes tasks autonomously (scheduling, drafting emails).
* Uses hierarchical agent architecture (supervisor-manager-worker agents).
* Implements contextual learning (embeddings memory).
* Integrates seamlessly with calendars, emails, task systems, and CRMs.
* Detects and flags knowledge gaps across teams.
