Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. Fixed JSON parsing issues in file storage adapter
2. Enhanced OpenAIConnector with circuit breaker pattern
3. Added proper token tracking and usage monitoring
4. Improved error handling with exponential backoff and retry logic
5. Added better logging throughout the LLM interaction flow
6. Updated BaseMeetingAnalysisAgent to properly use the OpenAIConnector

## Next Steps

1. Add LLM call logging to database for auditing and monitoring
2. Implement token usage dashboard in the admin interface
3. Create a toggle mechanism in UI for debug/production mode
4. Complete integration tests with real (but minimal) API calls
5. Add configurability for different OpenAI models

## Implementation Notes

- The system can now detect and handle rate limiting from OpenAI
- Error handling has been improved significantly
- The circuit breaker pattern prevents cascading failures
- Token usage tracking is now more accurate
