# Agent Protocol Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the Agent Protocol Tools to enhance the quality and consistency of the meeting analysis outputs. These changes address JSON parsing errors, improve the use of instruction templates, and replace dummy embeddings with real ones.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Real Embeddings Instead of Dummy Embeddings

**Issue:** The agent protocol tools were using random dummy embeddings for RAG queries, which reduced the relevance of retrieved context:

```typescript
// Old approach
const dummyEmbedding = new Array(1536).fill(0).map(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
```

**Solution:** Implemented real embeddings using OpenAI's embedding model with proper error handling:

```typescript
// New approach
try {
  const queryText = `Extract topics from: ${transcript.substring(0, 500)}`;
  queryEmbedding = await this.openAiConnector.generateEmbedding(queryText);
} catch (error) {
  // Fallback to dummy embeddings if necessary
  queryEmbedding = new Array(1536).fill(0).map(() => Math.random() - 0.5);
  this.logger.warn('Using fallback dummy embeddings due to error');
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Instruction Template Integration

**Issue:** The RAG prompt manager was using generic instructions that didn't fully utilize the specialized instruction templates.

**Solution:** Created detailed system messages that incorporate the full schema, rules, and output requirements from the instruction templates:

```typescript
const systemMessage = `You are a meeting analysis assistant that produces structured JSON output...

REQUIRED JSON SCHEMA:
{...}

RULES:
${templateDetails.rules?.map(rule => `- ${rule}`).join('\n')}

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
${templateDetails.outputRequirements?.map(req => `- ${req}`).join('\n')}
`;
```

### 3. Improved JSON Schema Enforcement

**Issue:** The JSON parsing errors were occurring because the schema requirements weren't clearly communicated to the LLM.

**Solution:** Created explicit JSON schema definitions in the system messages with examples:

```typescript
REQUIRED JSON SCHEMA:
{
  "meetingTitle": "A concise, descriptive title for the meeting",
  "summary": "Comprehensive meeting summary with speaker details",
  "decisions": [
    {
      "title": "Decision title",
      "content": "Detailed explanation of the decision"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Proper Transcript Inclusion

**Issue:** In some cases, the transcript wasn't being properly passed to OpenAI in the final prompt.

**Solution:** Ensured the transcript is included in both the RAG prompt and the fallback content:

```typescript
const response = await this.openAiConnector.generateResponse([
  { role: 'system', content: systemMessage },
  { role: 'user', content: ragPrompt.messages[0].content || instructionContent }
], {...});
```

## Client-Side Integration

The client-side `AnalysisResultResponse` interface was updated to match the new schema format, ensuring proper rendering of the enhanced analysis results.

## Error Handling

All tools now include comprehensive error handling with proper fallback to ensure:

1. Graceful degradation when embeddings fail
2. Properly formatted error responses that match the expected schema
3. Detailed error logging for debugging

## Testing Guidelines

When testing these enhancements, verify:

1. The meeting analysis produces proper JSON outputs
2. The summary follows the FINAL_MEETING_SUMMARY format with meetingTitle, summary, and decisions
3. Action items include proper assignees and structured data
4. Topics have names, descriptions, and other required attributes
5. Error cases still return valid JSON in the expected format
