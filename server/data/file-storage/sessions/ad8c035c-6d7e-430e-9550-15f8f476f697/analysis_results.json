{"id":"analysis_results","state":{"transcript":"[Alex]: Alright team, let’s get started. First up on today’s agenda is the new product detail page (PDP) rollout. Priya, could you give us an overview of where we're at?\n[Priya]: Sure. As of now, we’ve completed integration of the redesigned PDP in the frontend repo. It's behind the feature flag enable_new_pdp. Currently off in production but tested extensively in staging.\n[Sofia]: Great. Are we confident this won’t disrupt current users if we start enabling it gradually?\n[Priya]: Yes, we’ve implemented the rollout logic through LaunchDarkly. Initially, it targets about 5% of our active user base, mostly in Germany, then progressively ramps up.\n[Jamie]: And just to confirm, if we hit issues, we can quickly disable this feature, right?\n[Markus]: Yeah, precisely. From backend's perspective, all APIs feeding the PDP are backward compatible. We've added a new endpoint, /api/v2/product/details, for the new design, while /api/v1/product/info remains unchanged.\n[Elena]: Does the new endpoint change the data structure significantly? Last time we had some misalignments.\n[Markus]: Good question. It’s largely similar, but we’ve flattened some nested properties. For example, the price object now directly includes currency and formatted strings instead of nested arrays.\n[Elena]: Okay, good to know. I’ll double-check our adapters in the frontend to ensure we parse that correctly.\n[Rachel]: From a UX perspective, how is performance? I noticed a slight lag during initial image loads in staging.\n[Priya]: Yeah, we observed that too. It's related to how images load asynchronously. Jamie, could you elaborate on the lazy-loading implementation we’re using?\n[Jamie]: Sure. Currently, we’re using IntersectionObserver to lazy-load images once they enter the viewport. But we’ve seen delays due to CDN caching settings causing slow initial loads for high-res images.\n[Alex]: Can we optimize that somehow? Maybe using placeholder images or skeleton loaders?\n[Jamie]: Skeleton loaders would improve perceived performance. I’ll quickly prototype that to see if it makes a difference.\n[Rachel]: That would greatly enhance user experience, reducing perceived wait time.\n[Priya]: Markus, any potential backend optimizations we can make to image delivery?\n[Markus]: Possibly. Right now, images are served directly via Cloudinary. We could prefetch critical PDP images or serve low-res placeholders quicker. But this might involve some configuration overhead.\n[Sofia]: Is it significant enough that we’d want it before full rollout?\n[Alex]: It could be valuable. Jamie, Elena—what’s your take on the frontend implications?\n[Elena]: I think prefetching main product images might make sense. We could handle that with a preloading strategy on route entry.\n[Jamie]: Agreed. We can set up preloading using link rel=\"preload\" tags for the hero image at least, which should greatly improve first impression load.\n[Alex]: Great idea. Markus, could you check CDN config feasibility?\n[Markus]: Sure, I'll confirm today.\n[Sofia]: Regarding exception handling—what’s our fallback if the new PDP encounters unexpected issues?\n[Priya]: Right now, if the new component throws errors, our global React error boundary redirects users to the legacy PDP transparently. However, we log the error details via Sentry for analysis.\n[Rachel]: Will users see anything strange during this switch back?\n[Jamie]: They might notice a quick reload of the PDP, but no broken experience. It’s almost instantaneous.\n[Rachel]: Alright, good. Let’s ensure we’ve documented this fallback behavior clearly, so customer support is aware as well.\n[Sofia]: Priya, when would you feel comfortable scaling up beyond the initial 5%?\n[Priya]: Once we’ve monitored performance metrics in Grafana and confirmed no significant spikes in errors for at least 48 hours, we can move towards 20%.\n[Alex]: Sounds solid. Let’s coordinate closely on that monitoring. Elena, can you keep an eye on those dashboards?\n[Elena]: Absolutely. I'll set up alerts for key metrics—load times, errors, and API response times.\n[Alex]: Perfect. Any other points before we move forward?...
