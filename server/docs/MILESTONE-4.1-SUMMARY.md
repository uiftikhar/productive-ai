# Milestone 4.1: API Endpoint Implementation - Summary

This document summarizes the work completed for Milestone 4.1, which focused on implementing RESTful API endpoints and WebSocket support for meeting analysis.

## Core API Structure Enhancements

### 1. API Standardization

Implemented a standardized API response format:
- Created type definitions in `shared/api/types.ts`
- Implemented consistent error handling with proper error types and status codes
- Added standardized response utilities in `shared/api/response.ts`
- Implemented middleware to extend Express with standardized response methods

### 2. Error Handling Middleware

Added robust error handling:
- Implemented centralized error handling middleware in `shared/api/error-middleware.ts`
- Added request correlation with unique request IDs
- Created specialized error classes for common error scenarios
- Added structured logging of errors with proper context
- Implemented global uncaught exception handling

### 3. API Versioning

Added support for API versioning:
- Implemented version detection from URL path, headers, and query parameters
- Created versioned routers for different API versions
- Added support for deprecation warnings and sunset headers
- Structured routes to support multiple simultaneous API versions

## Meeting Analysis API

### 1. Session Management

Implemented session-based analysis workflow:
- Created `SessionManager` for managing analysis sessions
- Added persistence of session data to file storage
- Implemented session metadata tracking
- Added CRUD operations for sessions

### 2. Analysis Controller

Created a comprehensive controller for meeting analysis:
- Implemented the `MeetingAnalysisController` with hierarchical agent support
- Added integration with the hierarchical team factory
- Created methods for transcript submission and processing
- Implemented background processing of analysis tasks
- Added result retrieval endpoints

### 3. WebSocket Support

Added real-time updates via WebSockets:
- Created `MeetingAnalysisWebSocketHandler` for managing socket connections
- Implemented room-based session subscriptions
- Added event types for client-server communication
- Implemented real-time progress updates
- Added notification system for analysis milestones (topics, action items)
- Created a simulation mode for testing the WebSocket functionality

## Documentation

Created comprehensive API documentation:
- Documented the standard response format
- Added detailed endpoint specifications
- Included request and response examples
- Documented WebSocket events and message formats
- Added error code references

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with authentication and authorization systems
2. Add input validation using a schema validation library
3. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
4. Add support for pagination in list endpoints
5. Integrate with a proper database for session storage
6. Implement real analysis processing instead of simulation
7. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
