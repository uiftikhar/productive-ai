# Metacognitive Framework

## Overview

The Metacognitive Framework enhances agent autonomy by providing self-reflection, strategy adjustment, and learning capabilities. This framework enables agents to:

1. Assess their confidence in handling specific tasks
2. Monitor their own progress during execution
3. Adjust strategies when encountering obstacles
4. Learn from past executions to improve future performance
5. Plan their approach before beginning execution

## Key Components

### 1. Capability Self-Assessment

Agents can evaluate their confidence in handling specific tasks through the `assessCapability` method. This helps agents:

- Determine if they can handle a requested capability
- Evaluate their confidence level for different types of inputs
- Suggest alternative approaches if confidence is low
- Make informed decisions about delegation or escalation

Implementation:
- `SelfAssessmentRequest` and `SelfAssessmentResponse` interfaces
- `assessCapability` method in `MetacognitiveAgentImplementation`
- Confidence scoring system (0-1 scale) with qualitative levels

### 2. Progress Monitoring System

The `ProgressMonitoringService` tracks execution progress and detects when tasks stall or encounter obstacles. Key features:

- Task progress tracking with completion percentages
- Stall detection when progress stops for too long
- Anomaly detection for unexpected progress rates
- Event-driven notification system for issues
- Adaptation recommendations when progress is blocked

Implementation:
- `ProgressMonitoringService` singleton service
- `EnhancedTaskProgress` tracking interface
- Event-based notification system for progress updates and anomalies
- Runtime parameter tuning based on progress metrics

### 3. Strategy Adjustment Capabilities

The `StrategyAdjustmentService` manages strategy repositories and runtime adaptations. Features include:

- Strategy repositories for different capabilities
- Strategy selection based on task context
- Parameter adjustment during execution
- Recovery strategies for handling errors
- Strategy effectiveness tracking

Implementation:
- `StrategyAdjustmentService` singleton service
- `StrategyRepository` interface for storing strategies
- Runtime parameter adjustment based on execution feedback
- Strategy switching recommendations when progress stalls

### 4. Execution Memory

The `ExecutionMemoryService` stores execution history and recognizes patterns to improve future performance:

- Execution record storage with metadata
- Pattern recognition for similar tasks
- Similarity search for finding relevant past experiences
- Learning mechanism to improve strategies over time

Implementation:
- `ExecutionMemoryService` singleton service 
- `ExecutionRecord` interface for storing execution details
- `ExecutionPattern` interface for recognized patterns
- Pattern detection algorithms with confidence scoring

### 5. Self-Prompted Planning

The `SelfPlanningService` provides pre-execution analysis, approach selection, and resource estimation:

- Requirement analysis before beginning execution
- Approach comparison and selection
- Resource estimation for time and computational needs
- Bottleneck identification and mitigation
- Plan validation to assess likely success

Implementation:
- `SelfPlanningService` singleton service
- `PlanningContext` interface for task context
- `SelfPlanningResult` interface for comprehensive planning output
- Integration with both strategy and memory services

## Integration with Agent Lifecycle

The metacognitive framework integrates with the agent execution lifecycle through:

1. **Pre-execution phase**: 
   - Self-prompted planning to analyze requirements
   - Capability self-assessment
   - Strategy formulation and selection
   - Progress monitoring initialization

2. **Execution phase**:
   - Progress tracking and monitoring
   - Anomaly detection
   - Strategy adjustment when needed

3. **Post-execution phase**:
   - Reflection on execution outcome
   - Experience recording
   - Pattern recognition and learning updates

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Create a metacognitive agent
const agent = new MetacognitiveAgentImplementation(
  'Metacognitive Analysis Agent',
  'An agent with self-reflection capabilities',
  {
    reflectionConfig: {
      reflectionPoints: [
        ReflectionPointType.PRE_EXECUTION,
        ReflectionPointType.POST_EXECUTION,
      ],
      progressCheckpoints: [0.25, 0.5, 0.75],
      confidenceThresholds: {
        low: 0.4,
        high: 0.8,
      },
      adaptationThreshold: 0.6,
      reflectionDepth: 'normal',
    },
  }
);

// Execute a task with metacognitive capabilities
const response = await agent.execute({
  capability: 'data-analysis',
  input: complexData,
  context: {
    taskId: 'analysis-task-123',
  },
});
```

## Testing and Evaluation

The framework includes test scripts to demonstrate and evaluate its capabilities:

- `test-progress-monitoring.js`: Demonstrates progress monitoring
- `test-metacognitive-planning.js`: Shows self-prompted planning and learning

## Future Work

The metacognitive framework will continue to evolve with:

1. Enhanced pattern recognition using vectorized pattern storage
2. Improved strategy generation using LLM-based approach generation
3. Multi-agent coordination with shared metacognitive knowledge
4. Hierarchical planning with subtask decomposition
5. Integrated feedback mechanisms for external evaluation

## Implementation Status

All key components of the metacognitive framework have been implemented:

- ✅ Capability Self-Assessment
- ✅ Performance Monitoring 
- ✅ Strategy Adjustment
- ✅ Execution Memory
- ✅ Self-Prompted Planning
