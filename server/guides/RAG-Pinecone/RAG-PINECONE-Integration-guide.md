# RAG and Pinecone Integration Guide for NestJS

## Introduction

This guide outlines the implementation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in our NestJS application using Pinecone as the vector database. The integration follows Phase 6 of our migration plan and builds upon the foundations established in previous phases.

RAG enhances our meeting analysis system by providing context-aware processing, leveraging historical data, and improving the quality of agent responses. By combining the power of LLMs with retrieval mechanisms, we can deliver more accurate and contextually relevant meeting analyses.

## Architecture Overview

The RAG implementation follows a modular architecture that integrates with our existing LangGraph-based system:

```

                   v

                   v

             | Agent System    |
             |                 |
             +-----------------+
```

This architecture provides:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a specific responsibility
2. **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to update or replace individual modules
4. **Performance**: Optimized for retrieval and processing speed

In the following sections, we'll cover the implementation details for each module and provide guidance on configuration, optimization, and integration.
