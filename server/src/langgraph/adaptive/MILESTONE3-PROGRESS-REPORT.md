# Milestone 3: Adaptive Execution Engine - Progress Report

## Implementation Status
**Status**: COMPLETED âœ“

## Recent Updates

### Interface Improvements
- Added missing interfaces to support execution monitoring and adaptation:
  - `TaskStatus` enum for tracking execution states
  - `RecoveryPhase` enum for tracking recovery plan states
  - `FailureRecoveryAction` enum for tracking recovery actions
  - `AdjustmentType` enum for different adjustment strategies
  - `TaskPlan` interface for describing executable task plans
  - `PlanAdjustment` interface for describing adjustments to tasks
  - `RecoveryStrategy` interface for defining failure recovery strategies
  - `RecoveryContext` interface for providing context to recovery strategies
  - `RecoveryPlan` interface for coordinating recovery efforts

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed type issues in `PlanAdjustmentServiceImpl` class
  - Added proper type annotations to resolve implicit 'any' types
  - Added missing interface method implementations to ensure proper contract fulfillment
- Fixed type issues in `FailureRecoveryServiceImpl` class
  - Added proper type annotations for recovery contexts
  - Added missing interface method implementations to satisfy the contract

### Current Implementation
All twelve core services for the Adaptive Execution Engine have been fully implemented:

#### 1. Scheduler & Prioritization
- [x] **DynamicPrioritizationService** - 100% complete
- [x] **ContextAwareSchedulerService** - 100% complete
- [x] **DependencyAwareQueueService** - 100% complete

#### 2. Resource Management
- [x] **AgentAvailabilityService** - 100% complete
- [x] **CapabilityAllocationServiceImpl** - 100% complete
- [x] **LoadBalancingServiceImpl** - 100% complete

#### 3. Parallel Execution
- [x] **SynchronizationManagerService** - 100% complete
- [x] **ParallelDataSharingServiceImpl** - 100% complete
- [x] **MultiTaskProgressServiceImpl** - 100% complete

#### 4. Execution Monitoring
- [x] **PerformanceMonitorServiceImpl** - 100% complete
- [x] **PlanAdjustmentServiceImpl** - 100% complete
- [x] **FailureRecoveryServiceImpl** - 100% complete

### Testing
The comprehensive test script (`test-adaptive-execution.js`) demonstrates all aspects of the Adaptive Execution Engine with ten specific tests:

1. Priority-based scheduling
2. Context-aware scheduling
3. Dependency-aware execution
4. Resource allocation
5. Parallel execution
6. Shared data management
7. Progress tracking
8. Performance monitoring
9. Plan adjustment
10. Failure recovery

All tests are passing, and the system is fully functional.

## Summary
Milestone 3 has been successfully completed. The Adaptive Execution Engine now provides a sophisticated, priority-driven system that can adapt to changing execution contexts, manage resources intelligently, and recover from failures. The implementation supports parallel execution, dynamic prioritization, and continuous monitoring and adaptation.

## Next Steps
With Milestone 3 completed, we are ready to proceed to Milestone 4: Emergent Workflow Visualization. This will focus on creating visualization systems for workflows, agent reasoning, and team dynamics to provide insights into the adaptive execution processes.
