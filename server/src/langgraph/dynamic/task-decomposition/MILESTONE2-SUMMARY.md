# Milestone 2: Autonomous Task Decomposition

## Overview
This milestone focused on creating a system that enables AI agents to collaboratively break down complex problems into manageable subtasks. The implementation allows agents to analyze tasks, detect dependencies, estimate resource requirements, manage task hierarchies, and negotiate responsibilities.

## Implementation Approach
We implemented a modular, service-oriented architecture with clear interfaces and flexible components:

1. **Analysis First**: Tasks are analyzed for complexity, dependencies, and resource needs before decomposition
2. **Hierarchical Management**: Tasks are organized in parent-child relationships with milestone tracking
3. **Collaborative Definition**: Agents can jointly define tasks through proposals and consensus
4. **Dynamic Negotiation**: Agents can negotiate task boundaries, ownership, and responsibilities

## Core Services Implemented

### Task Analysis Framework
- **ComplexityAssessmentService**: Uses LLMs to analyze task difficulty and determine if decomposition is needed
- **DependencyDetectionService**: Identifies relationships and dependencies between tasks
- **ResourceEstimationService**: Calculates resource requirements for tasks

### Hierarchical Task Management
- **HierarchicalTaskService**: Manages parent-child task relationships and tracking
- **MilestoneDetectionService**: Identifies and tracks significant progress points in tasks
- **SubtaskDelegationService**: Assigns subtasks to appropriate agents based on capabilities

### Peer-Based Task Structures
- **CollaborativeTaskDefinitionService**: Enables agents to jointly define task boundaries
- **TaskConsensusManager**: Interface for managing voting and consensus on tasks

### Task Negotiation System
- **TaskNegotiationService**: Handles proposal/counter-proposal negotiation between agents
- **OwnershipDispute**: System for resolving conflicts about task ownership

## Architectural Decisions

### Service Consolidation
Several planned services were strategically consolidated to improve cohesion and reduce fragmentation:

1. **Task Negotiation Consolidation**:
   - Instead of creating separate services for `boundary-negotiation.service.ts` and `ownership-resolution.service.ts`, we consolidated functionality into a single `task-negotiation.service.ts`.
   - This approach provides a unified negotiation framework that handles various negotiation types (scope, ownership, resources, etc.) through a common interface.
   - The consolidated service improves maintainability by centralizing negotiation logic while supporting type-specific behaviors through the `NegotiationType` enum.

2. **Consensus as Interfaces Instead of Services**:
   - Rather than implementing a separate `task-consensus.service.ts`, we defined robust interfaces in `peer-task.interface.ts` that any service can implement.
   - The `TaskConsensusManager` interface defines all required operations for proposal management, voting, and responsibility assignment.
   - This approach enables flexible implementation of consensus mechanisms across different services while maintaining a consistent contract.

3. **Interface-First Design**:
   - We prioritized creating comprehensive interfaces before implementation, ensuring clear contracts between components.
   - This approach facilitates future extensions and alternative implementations without breaking existing code.
   - Each major functional area has its own interface file (task-analysis.interface.ts, hierarchical-task.interface.ts, etc.)

4. **Future Implementation of Shared Responsibility**:
   - While the interfaces for shared responsibility are defined in `peer-task.interface.ts`, the dedicated service implementation is planned as a next step.
   - The `ResponsibilityAssignment` interface and related types establish the foundation for the upcoming service.

### Rationale for Consolidation
The consolidation approach provides several benefits:

1. **Reduced Fragmentation**: Fewer, more cohesive services that handle related concerns
2. **Simplified Dependencies**: Services have clearer, less tangled dependencies
3. **Consistent Patterns**: Common patterns for negotiation, consensus, and responsibility management
4. **Future Flexibility**: Interface-first design allows multiple implementation strategies

## Key Interfaces
- **TaskAnalysis**: Interfaces for complexity assessment, dependency detection, and resource estimation
- **HierarchicalTask**: Interfaces for parent-child relationships and milestone tracking
- **PeerTask**: Interfaces for collaborative definition and consensus mechanisms
- **TaskNegotiation**: Interfaces for proposal frameworks and dispute resolution

## Integration with Dynamic Graph Engine
The autonomous task decomposition system integrates with the Dynamic Graph Engine from Milestone 1:

1. Task decomposition results can be used to create dynamic graph nodes and edges
2. Complex tasks can be dynamically decomposed during workflow execution
3. Task dependencies inform the graph structure and execution order
4. Resource requirements inform agent assignments within the workflow

## Benefits & Capabilities
- Agents can autonomously break down complex tasks without human intervention
- Task decomposition adapts to the specific complexity and requirements
- Collaborative definition ensures multiple agent perspectives are considered
- Task negotiation resolves conflicts and boundaries adaptively
- Milestone tracking provides clear progress indicators
- Hierarchical structure maintains context across decomposition levels

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with advanced planning systems
- Learning from past decomposition success/failure
- More sophisticated negotiation strategies
- Adaptive adjustment of decomposition strategies based on domain
- Runtime recombination of over-decomposed tasks
- Implementation of shared responsibility service for peer collaboration models
