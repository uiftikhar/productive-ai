# RAG Migration Guide: Using Dynamic Graph Service

## Overview

This guide outlines the process for migrating from the original `RAGGraphFactory` implementation to the new `DynamicRAGGraphFactory`, which leverages the `DynamicGraphService`. This migration provides several advantages:

1. **Runtime Graph Modifications**: Add, remove, or modify nodes and edges at runtime
2. **Better Error Handling**: Improved state management during execution
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Track execution paths and node performance metrics
4. **Standardized Implementation**: All graphs in the system now use the same foundation

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Replace Imports

Replace imports from `rag-graph.ts` with imports from `dynamic-rag-graph.ts`:

```typescript
// Old imports
import { RAGGraphFactory, RAGState } from '../rag/graph/rag-graph';

// New imports
import { DynamicRAGGraphFactory, RAGDynamicState } from '../rag/graph/dynamic-rag-graph';
```

### Step 2: Update State Interface Usage

The state interface has been updated to extend `DynamicGraphState`:

```typescript
// Old state interface usage
function processResult(result: RAGState) {
  // Process result
}

// New state interface usage
function processResult(result: RAGDynamicState) {
  // Process result
  // Access to additional properties like executionPath
  console.log(`Execution path: ${result.executionPath.join(' -> ')}`);
}
```

### Step 3: Update Factory Instantiation

Instantiation remains similar, but the class name has changed:

```typescript
// Old factory instantiation
const graphFactory = new RAGGraphFactory(ragService, logger);

// New factory instantiation
const graphFactory = new DynamicRAGGraphFactory(ragService, logger);
```

### Step 4: Update State Property Access

Note the changes in state property names:

| Old Property | New Property |
|--------------|--------------|
| `state.metadata` | `state.ragMetadata` |
| `state.config` | `state.ragConfig` |

Example:

```typescript
// Old state property access
const userId = state.metadata.userId;
const useAnalysis = state.config.useAnalysis;

// New state property access
const userId = state.ragMetadata.userId;
const useAnalysis = state.ragConfig.useAnalysis;
```

### Step 5: Use Execution Method

The primary execution method remains the same:

```typescript
// Both use the same execution method signature
const result = await graphFactory.execute(
  query,
  { 
    useAnalysis: true, 
    includeConversationContext: true 
  },
  { 
    userId: 'user-123', 
    conversationId: 'conv-456' 
  }
);
```

### Step 6: Leverage Dynamic Capabilities (Optional)

Take advantage of dynamic graph capabilities:

```typescript
// Get the underlying graph service
const graphService = graphFactory.getGraphService();

// Add a custom node at runtime
await graphService.applyModification({
  id: uuidv4(),
  type: GraphModificationType.ADD_NODE,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  node: {
    id: 'customPostprocessing',
    type: 'postprocessing',
    label: 'Response Post-processing',
    handler: async (state: RAGDynamicState) => {
      // Custom post-processing logic
      return {
        ...state,
        finalResponse: state.finalResponse + '\n\nThis response was enhanced by custom post-processing.'
      };
    }
  }
});

// Add an edge to the new node
await graphService.applyModification({
  id: uuidv4(),
  type: GraphModificationType.ADD_EDGE,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  edge: {
    id: 'response_to_postprocessing',
    source: 'responseGeneration',
    target: 'customPostprocessing',
    label: 'Response Generation → Post-processing'
  }
});

// Remove the edge from responseGeneration to END
// Find the edge ID first
const edgeToRemove = Array.from(graphService.getEdges().entries())
  .find(([_, edge]) => edge.source === 'responseGeneration' && edge.target === END);

if (edgeToRemove) {
  await graphService.applyModification({
    id: uuidv4(),
    type: GraphModificationType.REMOVE_EDGE,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    edgeId: edgeToRemove[0]
  });
}

// Add edge from custom node to END
await graphService.applyModification({
  id: uuidv4(),
  type: GraphModificationType.ADD_EDGE,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  edge: {
    id: 'postprocessing_to_end',
    source: 'customPostprocessing',
    target: END,
    label: 'Post-processing → End'
  }
});
```

## Testing Your Migration

1. Run the existing test suite to ensure basic functionality works
2. Run the new test file: `dynamic-rag-graph.test.ts`
3. Test dynamic modifications to ensure they work as expected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Type Errors**: Ensure you're using the `RAGDynamicState` type rather than `RAGState`
- **Property Access Errors**: Remember to use `ragConfig` and `ragMetadata` instead of `config` and `metadata`
- **Graph Modifications**: All modifications require an `id`, `type`, and `timestamp` property

### Comparison Chart

| Feature | Old RAG Graph | Dynamic RAG Graph |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Runtime modifications | No | Yes |
| State tracking | Basic | Advanced with execution path |
| Error recovery | Limited | Improved with state tracking |
| Performance monitoring | No | Yes, with metadata |
| Edge conditions | No | Yes, via conditional edges |
| Integration with other graphs | No | Yes, standardized interface |

## Complete Example

```typescript
import { DynamicRAGGraphFactory, RAGDynamicState } from '../rag/graph/dynamic-rag-graph';
import { UnifiedRAGService } from '../rag/core/unified-rag.service';
import { ConsoleLogger } from '../shared/logger/console-logger';

async function processQuery(query: string, userId: string, conversationId: string) {
  const logger = new ConsoleLogger();
  const ragService = new UnifiedRAGService({ logger });
  
  // Create graph factory
  const graphFactory = new DynamicRAGGraphFactory(ragService, logger);
  
  // Execute graph
  const result = await graphFactory.execute(
    query,
    {
      useAnalysis: true,
      includeConversationContext: true,
      temperature: 0.3
    },
    {
      userId,
      conversationId,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    }
  );
  
  // Return the result
  return {
    answer: result.finalResponse,
    context: result.retrievedContext,
    sources: result.contextSources,
    executionPath: result.executionPath,
    processingTime: result.ragMetadata.totalProcessingTime
  };
} 
```

2. **Update Dependent Components**
   - Update `SupervisorCoordinationService` to use the new implementation
   - Fix type errors in `HierarchicalTeamFactory` related to `AnalysisGoalType`
   - Update example implementation in `hierarchical-analysis-example.ts`

3. **Testing**
   - Create test cases for the new dynamic implementation
   - Verify that all functionality works as expected
   - Compare performance metrics between old and new implementation

### Phase 3: Base Adapters and Other Components

1. **Update BaseLangGraphAdapter**
   - Modify `createStateGraph` method to use `DynamicGraphService`
   - Create dynamic node/edge versions of all existing adapter implementations

2. **Update Example Implementations**
   - Convert all examples to use the new DynamicGraphService
   - Add examples demonstrating runtime graph modifications

3. **Update agentic-meeting-analysis Components**
   - Identify all StateGraph usages in the agentic-meeting-analysis modules
   - Convert each to use DynamicGraphService
   - Update documentation to reflect the new usage pattern

### Phase 4: Standardization and Cleanup

1. **Consistent Configuration Options**
   - Standardize configuration options across all graph implementations
   - Create utility functions for common graph patterns

2. **Code Duplication Reduction**
   - Remove duplicated code in graph creation logic
   - Create standard node/edge creation utilities

3. **Documentation and Training**
   - Create standard documentation for graph creation patterns
   - Update existing documentation to reference DynamicGraphService
   - Create code examples for reference

## Implementation Guidelines

### Creating Graphs

All new graph implementations should:

1. Use `DynamicGraphService` instead of directly instantiating `StateGraph`
2. Define state interfaces that extend `DynamicGraphState`
3. Use the modification API for adding/removing nodes and edges:

```typescript
// Add a node
graphService.applyModification({
  id: uuidv4(),
  type: GraphModificationType.ADD_NODE,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  node: myNode
});

// Add an edge
graphService.applyModification({
  id: uuidv4(),
  type: GraphModificationType.ADD_EDGE,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  edge: myEdge
});
```

### State Definition

State types should extend DynamicGraphState:

```typescript
export interface MyCustomState extends DynamicGraphState {
  // Custom state properties
  query: string;
  results: any[];
  metadata: {
    userId: string;
    // ...other metadata
  };
}
```

### Node Definition

Nodes should include explicit type and metadata:

```typescript
const myNode: DynamicGraphNode<MyCustomState> = {
  id: 'unique-node-id',
  type: 'processor', // Semantic type helps with visualization
  label: 'Human-readable label',
  handler: async (state: MyCustomState) => {
    // Node logic here
    return {
      ...state,
      // State updates
    };
  },
  metadata: {
    description: 'This node processes XYZ...',
    category: 'analysis',
    // Other metadata useful for visualization/monitoring
  }
};
```

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Runtime Flexibility**: Modify graphs at runtime based on inputs or changing conditions
2. **Better Monitoring**: Enhanced tracking of execution paths and node performance
3. **Visualization**: Improved graph visualization with more metadata
4. **Standardization**: Consistent approach to graph creation across the codebase
5. **Error Recovery**: Better error handling with state tracking
6. **Testing**: Simplified testing with standardized interfaces
7. **Code Maintenance**: Reduced duplication and standardized patterns

## Migration Timeline

- Phase 1: ✅ Complete
- Phase 2: 2 weeks
- Phase 3: 3 weeks
- Phase 4: 2 weeks

Total estimated time: 7 weeks

## Dependencies and Requirements

- LangGraph library (current version)
- UUID package for creating unique identifiers
- Jest for testing
- TypeScript 4.x or higher

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Risk**: Breaking changes in API consumption patterns
   **Mitigation**: Thorough testing and detailed migration guides

2. **Risk**: Performance overhead from additional tracking
   **Mitigation**: Performance testing and optimization of critical paths

3. **Risk**: Complexity in maintaining backward compatibility
   **Mitigation**: Maintain backward compatibility adapters where needed

## Conclusion

This migration will significantly improve the flexibility, maintainability, and observability of our LangGraph implementations. By standardizing on DynamicGraphService, we can create more adaptive and robust graph-based workflows while reducing code duplication and maintenance overhead.
