# Milestone 6: Performance Optimization & Security

This milestone focuses on performance optimization and security for the chat system, ensuring it can handle production-level loads while maintaining security best practices.

## Task 6.1: Implement Advanced Rate Limiting Strategies

- Implemented tiered rate limiting based on user subscription level (free, standard, premium, enterprise)
- Added sliding window algorithm for more accurate rate limiting
- Implemented endpoint-specific rate limits for sensitive operations
- Added configurable rate limit values with different thresholds for different API endpoints
- Applied stricter rate limits for unauthenticated requests

Implementation files:
- `src/chat/middleware/rate-limiter.ts`
- `src/api/routes/chat.routes.ts`

## Task 6.2: Add Caching Layer for Frequent Requests

- Added response caching middleware for GET requests
- Implemented cache key generation based on user ID and request URL
- Added cache headers for client-side cache control
- Implemented TTL (time to live) based caching with auto-expiration
- Added cache bypassing mechanisms for requests that need fresh data
- Implemented memory-efficient LRU (Least Recently Used) cache eviction 

Implementation files:
- `src/chat/middleware/cache-middleware.ts`
- `src/shared/services/cache/cache.service.ts`
- `src/api/routes/chat.routes.ts`

## Task 6.3: Optimize Database Queries for Conversation History

- Implemented query optimization with query planning based on filter conditions
- Added index utilization improvements for frequently accessed data
- Optimized limit and filter application for better query performance 
- Implemented smarter query logic that adjusts based on the type of search
- Added pagination to prevent large result sets
- Optimized timestamp-based filtering

Implementation files:
- `src/shared/services/user-context/conversation-context.service.ts`

## Task 6.4: Perform Security Audit and Implement Fixes

- Added security headers middleware with CSP (Content Security Policy)
- Implemented XSS protection headers
- Added CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection
- Implemented input sanitization for all user-provided data
- Added referrer policy headers
- Implemented strict transport security (HSTS)
- Added permissions policy (formerly feature policy)

Implementation files:
- `src/chat/middleware/security-headers.ts`
- `src/chat/middleware/input-sanitization.ts`
- `src/app.ts`

## Task 6.5: Add Monitoring for API and WebSocket Performance

- Implemented performance monitoring service with detailed metrics 
- Added request timing measurements for all API endpoints
- Implemented WebSocket monitoring for connection and message metrics
- Added status code distribution tracking
- Added error rate monitoring
- Implemented per-endpoint performance metrics
- Added system resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory)
- Added real-time performance metric reporting

Implementation files:
- `src/shared/services/monitoring/performance-monitor.ts`
- `src/app.ts`
- `src/websocket/socket.service.ts`

## Task 6.6: Load Test the Chat System Under Various Conditions

- Created a load testing script that simulates multiple concurrent users
- Implemented different test scenarios (normal, high-load, error-prone)
- Added metrics collection and reporting for load test results
- Implemented realistic user behavior simulation
- Added WebSocket and REST API testing in the same test
- Implemented randomized message content and timing
- Added error injection for robustness testing
- Implemented detailed test reporting

Implementation files:
- `src/chat/scripts/load-test.ts`
- `package.json` (added load-test script)

## Deliverable: Optimized, Secure Chat Backend Ready for Production

This milestone has successfully delivered an optimized and secure chat backend that is ready for production use. The system now includes advanced rate limiting, caching, query optimization, comprehensive security measures, detailed performance monitoring, and load testing capabilities. These enhancements ensure that the system can handle high loads, maintain performance under stress, and protect against common security vulnerabilities.
