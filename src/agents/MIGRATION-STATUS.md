# Migration Status

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of migrating from the legacy adapter-based architecture to the new connector-based architecture.

## Migration Status

| Component | Status | Issues/Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| **Core Interfaces** |
| `BaseAgentInterface` | ‚úÖ Complete | Renamed from `AgentInterface` for consistency |
| `LanguageModelProvider` | ‚úÖ Complete | Replaces `LanguageModelAdapter` |
| `ContextProvider` | ‚úÖ Complete | Replaces `ContextAdapter` |
| **Implementations** |
| `OpenAIConnector` | ‚úÖ Complete | Replaces `OpenAIAdapter` |
| `PineconeConnector` | ‚úÖ Complete | Replaces `PineconeAdapter` |
| `EmbeddingService` | ‚úÖ Complete | Updated to use connectors |
| **Agents** |
| `BaseAgent` | ‚úÖ Complete | Now implements `BaseAgentInterface` |
| `RetrievalAgent` | ‚úÖ Complete | Fully migrated to extend BaseAgent with proper patterns |
| `KnowledgeRetrievalAgent` | ‚úÖ Complete | Fully migrated to extend BaseAgent with proper patterns |
| `MeetingAnalysisAgent` | ‚úÖ Complete | Fully migrated to extend BaseAgent with proper patterns |
| `DecisionTrackingAgent` | üî¥ Not Started | |
| **Services** |
| `AgentRegistryService` | ‚úÖ Complete | Updated to use `BaseAgentInterface` |
| `AgentDiscoveryService` | ‚úÖ Complete | Updated to use `BaseAgentInterface` |
| `AgentFactory` | ‚úÖ Complete | New factory for creating and registering agents |
| **Testing** |
| Unit Tests | ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress | Added tests for BaseAgent and AgentFactory |
| Integration Tests | üî¥ Not Started | |
| **Cleanup** |
| `memory-client` directory | ‚úÖ Complete | Removed unused code |

## Linter Errors

### ~~RetrievalAgent~~
~~- Module '"../base/unified-agent"' has no exported member 'UnifiedAgent'~~ 
~~- Property 'registerCapability' does not exist on type 'RetrievalAgent'~~
~~- Property 'logger' does not exist on type 'RetrievalAgent'~~

### ~~KnowledgeRetrievalAgent~~
~~- Module '"../base/unified-agent"' has no exported member 'UnifiedAgent'~~
~~- Property 'logger' does not exist on type 'KnowledgeRetrievalAgent'~~
~~- Property 'registerCapability' does not exist on type 'KnowledgeRetrievalAgent'~~

### ~~MeetingAnalysisAgent~~
~~- Module '"../base/unified-agent"' has no exported member 'UnifiedAgent'~~
~~- Property 'logger' does not exist on type 'MeetingAnalysisAgent'~~
~~- Property 'registerCapability' does not exist on type 'MeetingAnalysisAgent'~~

## Remaining Tasks

1. ~~Fix import path for `BaseAgent` in all agent files~~ 
   ~~- Currently importing from `'../base/unified-agent'` which doesn't export a `UnifiedAgent'`~~

2. ~~Migrate `MeetingAnalysisAgent` to use BaseAgent~~

3. Update `DecisionTrackingAgent` to use new connectors and BaseAgent

4. ~~Remove old adapter files once all dependencies have been migrated~~

5. ‚úì Create test plan and implement unit tests for key components

6. Run comprehensive tests to ensure functionality is maintained
