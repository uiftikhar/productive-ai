## Introduction

The SupervisorAgent provides a coordination layer for multi-agent systems, enabling:

- Task planning and assignment based on agent capabilities
- Execution orchestration (sequential, parallel, or priority-based)
- Error handling and recovery for resilient systems
- Progress tracking and result aggregation

The SupervisorAgent should be used when you need to:
- Coordinate multiple specialized agents for complex workflows
- Dynamically assign tasks based on agent capabilities
- Implement fault tolerance with recovery mechanisms
- Scale agent workloads efficiently

## Integration Patterns

### LangGraph Workflow (Recommended)

The most powerful way to use the SupervisorAgent is through the SupervisorWorkflow with LangGraph:

```typescript
import { SupervisorAgent } from '../agents/specialized/supervisor-agent';
import { SupervisorAdapter } from '../langgraph/core/adapters/supervisor-adapter';

// Create specialized agents
const researchAgent = new ResearchAgent();
const analysisAgent = new AnalysisAgent();
// Initialize agents...

// Create supervisor with team members
const supervisor = new SupervisorAgent({
  defaultTeamMembers: [
    { agent: researchAgent, role: 'Researcher', priority: 8, active: true },
    { agent: analysisAgent, role: 'Analyst', priority: 6, active: true },
  ],
});

// Create the workflow adapter
const adapter = new SupervisorAdapter(supervisor);

// Execute coordinated tasks
const result = await adapter.executeCoordinatedTask(
  'Research and analyze renewable energy trends',
  [
    {
      description: 'Research renewable energy trends',
      requiredCapabilities: ['research'],
      priority: 9
    },
    {
      description: 'Analyze research findings',
      requiredCapabilities: ['data-analysis'],
      priority: 7
    }
  ],
  'sequential' // or 'parallel' or 'prioritized'
);
```

### Direct API Usage

For simpler use cases, you can use the SupervisorAgent directly:

```typescript
const result = await supervisor.execute({
  input: 'Coordinate research and analysis',
  capability: 'work-coordination',
  parameters: {
    tasks: [
      { 
        id: 'task1',
        name: 'Research Task',
        description: 'Research renewable energy',
        priority: 8
      }
    ],
    executionStrategy: 'sequential'
  }
});
```

## Task Design and Assignment

### Capability-Based Assignment

Design tasks with specific capability requirements:

```typescript
const task = {
  description: 'Analyze market trends',
  requiredCapabilities: ['data-analysis', 'market-knowledge'],
  priority: 8
};
```

The supervisor will match these capabilities to available agents.

### Best Practices for Task Design

1. **Be specific with capabilities**: Define precise capabilities rather than generic ones
2. **Set appropriate priorities**: Use 1-10 scale (10 being highest)
3. **Include constraints**: Add any timing or resource constraints in task metadata
4. **Consider dependencies**: For complex workflows, specify task dependencies
5. **Balance workload**: Avoid overloading specific agents with too many tasks

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Designing for Resilience

The SupervisorWorkflow provides robust error handling with automatic retries:

```typescript
// Configure retry behavior
const adapter = new SupervisorAdapter(supervisor, {
  maxRecoveryAttempts: 3 // Default is 3
});
```

### Recovery Strategies

The supervisor implements several recovery strategies:

1. **Retry with same agent**: First attempt to retry the failed task
2. **Reassign to different agent**: If retries fail, try a different agent with same capabilities
3. **Dynamic task modification**: Simplify or break down complex tasks that consistently fail
4. **Graceful degradation**: Continue with partial results if non-critical tasks fail

### Best Practices for Error Handling

1. **Design for partial success**: Ensure your system can function with partial results
2. **Provide fallback agents**: Have backup agents with similar capabilities
3. **Log detailed error context**: Include input data and task parameters in error logs
4. **Implement circuit breakers**: Prevent cascading failures by limiting retries
5. **Use a dead-letter queue**: Store failed tasks for manual review

## Performance Optimization

### Execution Strategies

Choose the right execution strategy based on your workload:

1. **Sequential**: For tasks with dependencies or when order matters
   ```typescript
   adapter.executeCoordinatedTask(input, tasks, 'sequential');
   ```

2. **Parallel**: For independent tasks that can run concurrently
   ```typescript
   adapter.executeCoordinatedTask(input, tasks, 'parallel');
   ```

3. **Prioritized**: For mixed-priority tasks where some are more urgent
   ```typescript
   adapter.executeCoordinatedTask(input, tasks, 'prioritized');
   ```

### Resource Optimization

1. **Task batching**: Group similar small tasks to reduce overhead
2. **Concurrency limits**: Set appropriate limits based on resource availability
   ```typescript
   supervisor.execute({
     parameters: {
       concurrencyLimit: 5 // Limit to 5 concurrent tasks
     }
   });
   ```
3. **Timeout management**: Set reasonable timeouts to prevent hung tasks
   ```typescript
   supervisor.execute({
     parameters: {
       taskTimeoutMs: 30000 // 30 second timeout per task
     }
   });
   ```

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

1. **Agent pools**: Create pools of similar agents for load balancing
2. **Stateless design**: Ensure agents are stateless for easier scaling
3. **Distributed execution**: Use message queues for distributed task processing

### Vertical Scaling

1. **Resource allocation**: Allocate memory and compute based on task complexity
2. **Batch processing**: Process multiple related items in single agent calls
3. **Caching**: Implement caching for repeated agent operations

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection

The SupervisorWorkflow provides built-in metrics:

```typescript
// Access metrics after execution
const result = await adapter.executeCoordinatedTask(...);
console.log(result.metrics); // Execution time, success rate, etc.
```

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Task success rate**: Percentage of tasks completed successfully 
2. **Average execution time**: Time to complete tasks by type
3. **Recovery rate**: Percentage of failed tasks successfully recovered
4. **Agent utilization**: How evenly work is distributed
5. **Error frequency**: Rate of errors by agent and task type

### Implementing Observability

1. **Structured logging**: Use consistent log formats with correlation IDs
2. **Tracing**: Enable tracing in the SupervisorAdapter
   ```typescript
   const adapter = new SupervisorAdapter(supervisor, {
     tracingEnabled: true
   });
   ```
3. **Visualization**: Create dashboards for key performance metrics
4. **Alerting**: Set up alerts for critical failures and performance degradation

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing

Test individual agents with mock data:

```typescript
// Mock the supervisor's team members
jest.spyOn(supervisor, 'listTeamMembers').mockReturnValue([
  { agent: mockAgent, role: 'Researcher', priority: 5, active: true }
]);
```

### Integration Testing

Test full workflows with multiple agents:

```typescript
// Create test workflow
const testWorkflow = new SupervisorWorkflow(supervisor);

// Execute test with predefined tasks
const result = await testWorkflow.execute({
  input: 'Test coordination workflow',
  parameters: { tasks: testTasks }
});

// Verify outputs and agent interactions
expect(mockAgent.execute).toHaveBeenCalled();
expect(result.output).toContain('expected output');
```

### Simulation Testing

Run comprehensive simulations with error injection:

1. Create scenarios with intentional failures
2. Test recovery mechanisms under load
3. Measure performance metrics under realistic conditions
