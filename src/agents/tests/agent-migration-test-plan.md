# Agent Migration Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for verifying the functionality of the migrated agent architecture.

## 1. Unit Tests

### BaseAgent Implementation

- [ ] Test the `BaseAgent` abstract class with a simple implementation
- [ ] Verify all interface methods are properly implemented
- [ ] Test error handling in the `execute` method 
- [ ] Verify metrics collection works correctly

### Agent Factory

- [ ] Test creation of each agent type
- [ ] Verify agent registration with the registry 
- [ ] Test dependency injection of custom connectors and services
- [ ] Verify options are properly passed to agent constructors

### Agent Registry

- [ ] Test registration of multiple agents
- [ ] Test retrieving agents by ID
- [ ] Test finding agents by capability
- [ ] Verify singleton pattern works correctly

## 2. Integration Tests

### Knowledge Retrieval Agent

- [ ] Test retrieving knowledge with various queries
- [ ] Verify context retrieval from different sources
- [ ] Test with real and mock connectors
- [ ] Verify RAG context enhancement

### Document Retrieval Agent

- [ ] Test storing documents
- [ ] Test retrieving documents by similarity
- [ ] Test filtering and sorting functionality
- [ ] Verify vector embeddings are generated correctly

### Meeting Analysis Agent

- [ ] Test transcript analysis
- [ ] Verify topic extraction
- [ ] Test action item identification
- [ ] Verify context storage functionality

## 3. Workflow Tests

### LangGraph Integration

- [ ] Test agent execution in LangGraph workflows
- [ ] Verify state management
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery
- [ ] Verify workflow completion with various agents

### Multi-Agent Workflows

- [ ] Test workflows that use multiple agents in sequence
- [ ] Verify context passing between agents
- [ ] Test capability-based agent selection
- [ ] Verify end-to-end execution with mixed agent types

## 4. Migration Verification

### Interface Compatibility

- [ ] Verify all agents implement the `BaseAgentInterface`
- [ ] Test backward compatibility with code expecting `AgentInterface`
- [ ] Verify type safety throughout the codebase
- [ ] Test with TypeScript strict mode enabled

### Legacy Code Removal

- [ ] Verify old adapter code is removed
- [ ] Ensure no imports of deprecated modules
- [ ] Verify no references to unused code
- [ ] Test application without the memory-client directory

## 5. Performance Tests

### Resource Usage

- [ ] Measure memory usage before and after migration
- [ ] Compare execution time for key operations
- [ ] Test under high concurrency conditions
- [ ] Verify garbage collection and resource cleanup

### Scalability

- [ ] Test with large numbers of agents
- [ ] Verify performance with many concurrent requests
- [ ] Test with large context sizes
- [ ] Measure response times under load

## Test Execution Plan

1. **Setup Testing Environment**
   - Configure test database/vector stores
   - Set up mock LLM providers
   - Prepare test data for each agent type

2. **Execute Unit Tests**
   - Run core component tests
   - Verify interface implementation
   - Test factory and registry

3. **Run Integration Tests**
   - Test each agent type separately
   - Verify end-to-end functionality
   - Test with both mock and real dependencies

4. **Workflow Testing**
   - Test single-agent workflows
   - Test multi-agent workflows
   - Verify state management

5. **Performance Comparison**
   - Benchmark against pre-migration codebase
   - Document any performance changes
   - Identify optimization opportunities

## Test Implementation

Example test for agent factory:

```typescript
import { AgentFactory } from '../factories/agent-factory';
import { AgentRegistryService } from '../services/agent-registry.service';
import { MockLogger } from './mocks/mock-logger';

describe('AgentFactory', () => {
  let factory: AgentFactory;
  let registry: AgentRegistryService;
  let logger: MockLogger;

  beforeEach(() => {
    logger = new MockLogger();
    registry = AgentRegistryService.getInstance(logger);
    factory = new AgentFactory({ logger, registry });
  });

  test('creates knowledge retrieval agent', async () => {
    const agent = factory.createKnowledgeRetrievalAgent();
    expect(agent).toBeDefined();
    expect(agent.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(agent.name).toBe('Knowledge Retrieval Agent');
    
    // Verify registration
    const registeredAgent = registry.getAgent(agent.id);
    expect(registeredAgent).toBe(agent);
  });

  // Add more tests...
});
```
