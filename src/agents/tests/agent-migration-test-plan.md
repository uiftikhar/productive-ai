# Agent Migration Test Plan

This document outlines the test plan for verifying the functionality of the migrated agent architecture.

## 1. Unit Tests

- [x] Verify context storage functionality

## 3. Workflow Tests

### LangGraph Integration

- [x] Test agent execution in LangGraph workflows
- [x] Verify state management

- [x] Verify workflow completion with various agents

### Multi-Agent Workflows

- [ ] Test workflows that use multiple agents in sequence

- [ ] Verify end-to-end execution with mixed agent types

## 4. Migration Verification

### Interface Compatibility

- [x] Verify all agents implement the `BaseAgentInterface`
- [x] Test backward compatibility with code expecting `AgentInterface`
- [x] Verify type safety throughout the codebase
- [x] Test with TypeScript strict mode enabled

### Legacy Code Removal

- [x] Verify old adapter code is removed
- [x] Ensure no imports of deprecated modules
- [x] Verify no references to unused code
- [x] Test application without the memory-client directory

## 5. Performance Tests

### Resource Usage

- [ ] Measure memory usage before and after migration
- [ ] Compare execution time for key operations
- [ ] Test under high concurrency conditions
- [ ] Verify garbage collection and resource cleanup

### Scalability

- [ ] Test with large numbers of agents
- [ ] Verify performance with many concurrent requests
- [ ] Test with large context sizes
- [ ] Measure response times under load

## Post-Migration Testing Priorities

1. **Multi-Agent Workflows**
   - Create tests for workflows that involve multiple agents
   - Verify proper context passing between agents
   - Test capability-based routing

2. **Performance Benchmarking**
   - Establish baseline performance metrics
   - Compare with pre-migration performance
   - Identify opportunities for optimization

3. **Error Handling Robustness**
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Verify graceful degradation
   - Confirm all errors are properly logged

4. **LangSmith Tracing Integration**
   - Verify traces are properly captured
   - Test trace visualization
   - Confirm proper correlation of traces to requests

5. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Create comprehensive end-to-end tests
   - Verify real-world usage patterns
   - Test with production-like data volumes

## Test Implementation Status

| Test Category | Implemented | Passing | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Unit Tests | 90% | 100% | All implemented tests passing |
| Integration Tests | 85% | 100% | Core agent tests complete |
| Workflow Tests | 70% | 100% | Multi-agent tests pending |
| Migration Verification | 100% | 100% | All verification complete |
| Performance Tests | 40% | N/A | Benchmarking in progress |

## Next Steps

1. Complete multi-agent workflow tests
2. Implement comprehensive performance benchmarks
3. Create additional end-to-end tests
4. Add continuous monitoring for agent performance

## Test Execution Plan

1. **Setup Testing Environment**
   - Configure test database/vector stores
   - Set up mock LLM providers
   - Prepare test data for each agent type

2. **Execute Unit Tests**
   - Run core component tests
   - Verify interface implementation
   - Test factory and registry

3. **Run Integration Tests**
   - Test each agent type separately
   - Verify end-to-end functionality
   - Test with both mock and real dependencies

4. **Workflow Testing**
   - Test single-agent workflows
   - Test multi-agent workflows
   - Verify state management

5. **Performance Comparison**
   - Benchmark against pre-migration codebase
   - Document any performance changes
   - Identify optimization opportunities

## Test Implementation

Example test for agent factory:

```typescript
import { AgentFactory } from '../factories/agent-factory';
import { AgentRegistryService } from '../services/agent-registry.service';
import { MockLogger } from './mocks/mock-logger';

describe('AgentFactory', () => {
  let factory: AgentFactory;
  let registry: AgentRegistryService;
  let logger: MockLogger;

  beforeEach(() => {
    logger = new MockLogger();
    registry = AgentRegistryService.getInstance(logger);
    factory = new AgentFactory({ logger, registry });
  });

  test('creates knowledge retrieval agent', async () => {
    const agent = factory.createKnowledgeRetrievalAgent();
    expect(agent).toBeDefined();
    expect(agent.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(agent.name).toBe('Knowledge Retrieval Agent');
    
    // Verify registration
    const registeredAgent = registry.getAgent(agent.id);
    expect(registeredAgent).toBe(agent);
  });

  // Add more tests...
});
```
