# Agent Visualization Dashboard

## Overview

This dashboard will provide a comprehensive visualization interface for monitoring and interacting with the agent ecosystem. Leveraging LangGraph's visualization capabilities, the dashboard will display agent workflows, state transitions, and performance metrics in real-time.

## Features

### 1. Agent Ecosystem Visualization
- Interactive graph visualization of all agents and their relationships
- Color-coded nodes representing different agent types (Supervisor, KnowledgeGap, ThemeClassifier, etc.)
- Connection lines showing communication patterns and dependencies

### 2. Workflow Monitoring
- Real-time visualization of LangGraph workflows as they execute
- State transition diagrams with animated transitions
- Node inspection for detailed state information

### 3. Performance Metrics
- Response time tracking for agent operations
- Token usage and cost estimation per agent
- Success/failure rates and error tracking

### 4. Debugging Tools
- Trace visualization for complex workflows
- Step-through debugging of agent executions
- State inspection at each step of the workflow

### 5. Interactive Testing
- Direct interaction with agents through the dashboard
- Ability to inject custom inputs and observe responses
- Comparison of results across different agent versions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Create Next.js application with Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS
- Implement basic layout and navigation
- Set up WebSocket connections for real-time updates

### Phase 2: LangGraph Integration
- Connect to LangGraph's tracing capabilities
- Implement graph visualization using React Flow
- Create state inspectors for workflow monitoring

### Phase 3: Agent Catalog
- Build agent discovery and registration system
- Create detailed agent profile pages
- Implement capability exploration interface

### Phase 4: Performance Monitoring
- Add metrics collection and visualization
- Implement historical performance tracking
- Create alerting for performance issues

### Phase 5: Interactive Testing Console
- Build an interactive console for direct agent testing
- Implement request crafting interface
- Create response visualization tools

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: React Flow for agent relationships and workflows
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Zustand for client state
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.io for WebSocket connections

### Backend Integration
- Connects to existing agent infrastructure
- Utilizes LangGraph's tracing and visualization capabilities
- Implements lightweight proxy for agent interactions

### Deployment
- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
- Scalable hosting with Vercel or similar platform

## LangGraph Visualization Integration

The dashboard will leverage LangGraph's built-in visualization capabilities:

```typescript
// Example of how we'll integrate with LangGraph tracing
import { TracingManager } from '../../langgraph/core/utils/tracing';

const tracingManager = TracingManager.getInstance();
const traces = tracingManager.getTraces();

// Convert traces to visualization format
const graphData = convertTracesToGraph(traces);

// Render with React Flow
return (
  <ReactFlow
    nodes={graphData.nodes}
    edges={graphData.edges}
    onNodeClick={handleNodeClick}
  />
);
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed component specifications
2. Build initial prototype of the graph visualization
3. Connect to LangGraph tracing system
4. Implement real-time update mechanisms
